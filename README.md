# Forex-Ichimuku-Indicators

In this projetc I used pandas library to calculate Ichimoku indicators for Forex trade data.
Also it can be use for stock market or other trade platform wich prica have high and low for a time duration.

In the code I asume that or trade data is in a pandas dataframe which contains columns labeled 'High' and 'Low'
